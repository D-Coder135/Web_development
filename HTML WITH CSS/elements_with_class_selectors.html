  <p>Whether the drafting of a paragraph begins with a main idea or
    whether that idea surfaces in the revision process, once you have
    that main idea, youâ€™ll want to make sure that the idea has enough
    support. The job of the paragraph body is to develop and support
    the topic.</p>
    <p class="highlight">This is P with CLASS="highlight"</p>
    <div class="mainpoint highlight">This is the main point of the
      entire article.
