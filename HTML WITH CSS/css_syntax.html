    <h1>ANATOMY OF A CSS RULE ---></h1>
    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
    <p>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
      how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
      contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.</p>
    <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
    <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to
      format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles,
      table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only
      be defined in a page's HTML.</p>
