  Version control systems are a category of software
  tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a
  track of modifications done to the code. Use of
  Version Control System: A repository: It can be
  thought as a database of changes. It contains all the
  edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the
  project.

  Given Microsoft's recent acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion, there has been an incredible amount of interest in the distributed version control program known as Git. Git vs. GitHub comparisons are constantly being requested, and questions about how they work together are constantly being asked. There are indeed quite a few similarities between the two version control systems, but it is the differences between Git and GitHub that are most pertinent. This article will attempt to appease all of those readers who are asking for a Git vs GitHub comparison, while dispelling the common misconception that Git and GitHub are the same.

  In order to properly discuss the how Git and GitHub are similar, where they diverge, and how they intersect, an individual understanding of each tool is important.

  What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
  Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code history, while GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool. Git is a tool a developer installs locally on their computer, while GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.

  One way to examine the differences between GitHub and Git is to look at their competitors. Git competes with centralized and distributed version control tools such as Subversion, Mercurial, ClearCase and IBM's Rational Team Concert. On the other hand, GitHub competes with cloud-based SaaS and PaaS offerings, such as GitLab and Atlassian's Bitbucket.
